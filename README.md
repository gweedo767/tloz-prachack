## Number layout

- Timer: Secs and frames. Will display how long last screen took, and updates during a transition.

- Consecutive kill counter (0-255)

- Consecutive 10 kill counter (0-10)

- Drop counter

## TODO

Maybe in 20018 sometimes, or sooner:

- Show when you're on a good pixel for the screen wrap trick

- Teleport to dungeons

- Manipulate Link state (heart containers, items)

## Contribute

The asm code compiles with xkas-plus 0.14 or something like that. Check the Makefile.

## Changelog

**v1.1**

- Fixed a bug that was causing the counters to be drawn every frame. Game is very similar to the normal cart, in regards to lag, now.

**v1.0**

- Initial release.
